# Airline-Bird-Strike-Practicum
This analysis looks at incident reports of birds impacting aircraft in the United States. A normalized database was defined and various methods avaiable in R were used to clean, 
harmonize, and further prepare the data contained in the csv file. After hosting the database through Amazon Web Service, the tables were populated and analysis was conducted by querying the 
database.
